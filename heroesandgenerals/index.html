				<b>General Description</b><br><br>
				Heroes & Generals is a free-to-play first-person shooter and real-time strategy video game set in World War II<br>
				developed and published by Reto-Moto now by TLM since February 3 2022. Reto-Moto was founded by some of the original<br>
				founders of IO Interactive and the Hitman series.[1] The developers called it a "mass participation game" in contrast<br>
				to a traditional massively multiplayer online game, where the actions in the FPS-part of the game reflect into the<br>
				strategy-part.[2] The player can use weapons from Germany, the United States, and the Soviet Union.<br><br>
				<b>Assault</b><br><br>
				In assault, one team will be defending from an offensive team, or in rare cases, two offensive teams. The goal of the<br>
				offensive team is to seize two or three (depending on the map) main control points, while the defensive team has to<br>
				defend those points. These main control points are linked by smaller strategic positions that must be taken prior to<br>
				the next successive point being eligible for capture. The offensive team wins if it captures all main control points,<br>
				while the defensive team can win by either holding out with all main control points until a timer runs out, or capturing<br>
				all the offensive team's control points. Assault cannot be played by players until their player level is IV. This unlocks<br>
				the Assault maps, after which all soldiers owned by that player can play Assault, regardless of rank.<br><br>
				<b>Skirmish</b><br><br>
				Skirmishes are basic games that can be played by any character that has reached Rank I (i.e. completed one Encounter battle).<br>
				Skirmishes consist of two teams that each have a spawn point. These teams must then fight for control over three control points <br>
				01, 02, and 03). When a team is holding a point, a bar for that team at the top of the screen gradually fills up. The more<br>
				control points occupied, the faster the bar will fill. The game ends when one team succeeds in holding multiple control points<br>
				for long enough.<br><br>
				<b>Encounter</b><br><br>
				The Encounter game mode is a simplified version of a skirmish, designed for new players, but available for play by all. Like a<br>
				skirmish, a team wins when it has held control points long enough to fill a bar at the top of the screen, but unlike a skirmish,<br>
				there is only one control point (01). This allows new players to get a feel for the game, and will let them proceed to Skirmishes<br>
				following their first Encounter round.
